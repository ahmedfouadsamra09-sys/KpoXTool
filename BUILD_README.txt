Kapo x tool - Project Ready to Build
------------------------------------

App name (label): Kapo x tool
Package name: com.kapo.xtool

How to build (recommended - Android Studio):
1. Open Android Studio.
2. Choose 'Open' and select the project folder: /mnt/data/FakeMod_FreeFire_project
3. Let Android Studio sync Gradle. If it asks to update Gradle plugin, accept the recommended update.
4. Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)
5. The debug APK will be at: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

About Gradle Wrapper:
- This ZIP currently does NOT include the gradle wrapper JAR.
- If you want to build from command line using './gradlew assembleDebug', one of the following will work:
  a) Open project in Android Studio and let it generate/refresh the Gradle wrapper for you.
  b) If you have Gradle installed locally, run 'gradle wrapper' in the project root to generate wrapper files.
  c) I can add a full wrapper to the project on request (I will include gradlew, gradlew.bat and wrapper files).

If you want any further change (icons, colors, texts in Arabic, more fake features) tell me and I'll update the project.
